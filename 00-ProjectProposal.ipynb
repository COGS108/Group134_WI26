    "NBA player salaries operate under a hard salary-cap system, which forces teams to divide a fixed pool of money across an entire roster. Because the cap changes from season to season, analysts often break salary figures down into share-of-cap terms to make contracts comparable across years. In this project, we ask whether commonly available performance data—basic box-score averages (points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks) and selected advanced metrics (TS%, PER, BPM, and WS/48)—can explain how much of the cap a player earns in the following season. Framing the outcome this way helps factor out inflation effects from the analysis and keeps the focus on how teams appear to value on-court production when they set contracts.<a href=\"#ref1\"><sup>1</sup></a><a href=\"#ref2\"><sup>2</sup></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior research in sports economics consistently finds that teams still pay heavily for visible box-score output, particularly scoring. Studies that model NBA salaries using traditional performance variables often show that points per game, minutes, and assists explain a substantial portion of salary variation, even after accounting for other factors. One applied analysis of NBA salary determinants finds that scoring remains one of the strongest predictors of pay, suggesting that front offices continue to price offensive volume into contracts even as analytics become more common.<a href=\"#ref3\"><sup>3</sup></a> These findings help set a baseline model up for our study, where box-score averages serve as the starting point for explaining salary share.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, salary does not track box-score production perfectly. Contracts also factor in reputation, age, injury risk, positional demand, and the timing of free agency, all of which can pull pay away from pure statistical output. To fill in these gaps, analysts have increasingly brought advanced metrics into salary models in an effort to pick up value teams might otherwise miss. Papadaki and Tsagris (2020) model NBA salary share directly using machine-learning methods and show that performance variables can explain a meaningful share of compensation, while also demonstrating that salary outcomes remain noisy and difficult to pin down exactly.<a href=\"#ref4\"><sup>4</sup></a> Their work motivates our decision to focus on salary share and to compare how different sets of performance metrics explain it.\n",
    "\n",
    "More recent academic and student research has followed a similar path by combining traditional and advanced statistics to study player valuation and pay inequality. These projects often find that while stars dominate the top end of the salary distribution, certain efficient or high-impact role players appear underpaid relative to their statistical contribution. One such study categorizes players by role and shows that efficiency-based metrics help explain why some lower-usage players provide strong on-court value without receiving star-level contracts.<a href=\"#ref5\"><sup>5</sup></a> This body of work helps tie our hypothesis down: advanced metrics may not replace raw scoring as the strongest individual predictor, but they may improve overall model fit and reduce prediction error for non-star players.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advanced metrics used in this project are well established in public basketball analytics. TS% adjusts scoring efficiency by accounting for three-point shooting and free throws, while BPM and WS/48 aim to roll a player's total impact into a single number that adjusts for playing time and team context. These metrics attempt to build efficiency and impact into one measure, making them especially useful for evaluating players who log fewer minutes but perform well when on the floor.<a href=\"#ref1\"><sup>1</sup></a><a href=\"#ref6\"><sup>6</sup></a><a href=\"#ref7\"><sup>7</sup></a> By comparing a box-score-only model to one that folds these advanced metrics in, our project tests whether teams implicitly reward this type of efficiency when they set future salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this study contributes by examining multiple seasons (2016–17 through 2023–24) and by linking performance in one season to salary share in the next. This approach better reflects how front offices operate, since teams pay players based on expected future value rather than past production alone. By comparing stars and role players using the same model, we test whether advanced metrics narrow the difference between what players are paid and what their performance predicts, especially for players whose value is not well captured by per-game averages.\n",
