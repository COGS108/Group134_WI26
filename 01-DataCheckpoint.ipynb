    "NBA player salaries operate under a hard salary-cap system, which forces teams to divide a fixed pool of money across an entire roster. Because the cap changes from season to season, analysts often break salary figures down into share-of-cap terms to make contracts comparable across years. In this project, we ask whether commonly available performance data—basic box-score averages (points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks) and selected advanced metrics (TS%, PER, BPM, and WS/48)—can explain how much of the cap a player earns in the following season. Framing the outcome this way helps factor out inflation effects from the analysis and keeps the focus on how teams appear to value on-court production when they set contracts.<a href=\"#ref1\"><sup>1</sup></a><a href=\"#ref2\"><sup>2</sup></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior research in sports economics consistently finds that teams still pay heavily for visible box-score output, particularly scoring. Studies that model NBA salaries using traditional performance variables often show that points per game, minutes, and assists explain a substantial portion of salary variation, even after accounting for other factors. One applied analysis of NBA salary determinants finds that scoring remains one of the strongest predictors of pay, suggesting that front offices continue to price offensive volume into contracts even as analytics become more common.<a href=\"#ref3\"><sup>3</sup></a> These findings help set a baseline model up for our study, where box-score averages serve as the starting point for explaining salary share.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, salary does not track box-score production perfectly. Contracts also factor in reputation, age, injury risk, positional demand, and the timing of free agency, all of which can pull pay away from pure statistical output. To fill in these gaps, analysts have increasingly brought advanced metrics into salary models in an effort to pick up value teams might otherwise miss. Papadaki and Tsagris (2020) model NBA salary share directly using machine-learning methods and show that performance variables can explain a meaningful share of compensation, while also demonstrating that salary outcomes remain noisy and difficult to pin down exactly.<a href=\"#ref4\"><sup>4</sup></a> Their work motivates our decision to focus on salary share and to compare how different sets of performance metrics explain it.\n",
    "\n",
    "More recent academic and student research has followed a similar path by combining traditional and advanced statistics to study player valuation and pay inequality. These projects often find that while stars dominate the top end of the salary distribution, certain efficient or high-impact role players appear underpaid relative to their statistical contribution. One such study categorizes players by role and shows that efficiency-based metrics help explain why some lower-usage players provide strong on-court value without receiving star-level contracts.<a href=\"#ref5\"><sup>5</sup></a> This body of work helps tie our hypothesis down: advanced metrics may not replace raw scoring as the strongest individual predictor, but they may improve overall model fit and reduce prediction error for non-star players.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advanced metrics used in this project are well established in public basketball analytics. TS% adjusts scoring efficiency by accounting for three-point shooting and free throws, while BPM and WS/48 aim to roll a player's total impact into a single number that adjusts for playing time and team context. These metrics attempt to build efficiency and impact into one measure, making them especially useful for evaluating players who log fewer minutes but perform well when on the floor.<a href=\"#ref1\"><sup>1</sup></a><a href=\"#ref6\"><sup>6</sup></a><a href=\"#ref7\"><sup>7</sup></a> By comparing a box-score-only model to one that folds these advanced metrics in, our project tests whether teams implicitly reward this type of efficiency when they set future salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, this study contributes by examining multiple seasons (2016–17 through 2023–24) and by linking performance in one season to salary share in the next. This approach better reflects how front offices operate, since teams pay players based on expected future value rather than past production alone. By comparing stars and role players using the same model, we test whether advanced metrics narrow the difference between what players are paid and what their performance predicts, especially for players whose value is not well captured by per-game averages.\n",

    "2. Write a few paragraphs about this dataset. Make sure to cover\n",
    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
    "3. Use the cell below to \n",
    "    1. load the dataset \n",
    "    2. make the dataset tidy or demonstrate that it was already tidy\n",
    "    3. demonstrate the size of the dataset\n",
    "    4. find out how much data is missing, where its missing, and if its missing at random or seems to have any systematic relationships in its missingness\n",
    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
    "4. Optionally you can also show some summary statistics for variables that you think are important to the project\n",
